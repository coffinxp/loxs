Extend functionality to handle URLs without query parameters (like https://example.com/en/) Inject payloads into the path or even append payloads to the end of the URL.

Inject Payloads into the Path:

    If the URL has no query parameters, the payload is appended to the path.
    Example: https://example.com/en/ → https://example.com/en/PAYLOAD

Handle Root URLs:

    For URLs like https://example.com/, the payload is appended directly:
        https://example.com/ → https://example.com/PAYLOAD

Preserve Existing Behavior:

    Query parameter injection logic remains unchanged.
